This was a monitoring service for a data engineering class I took. 

We were given the chance to use whatever technologies we wanted to monitor an entire floor of IT lab computer usage. They were hoping we would use k8s and other high powered tech. But that was overkill, so I wrote these few scripts and had better performance / robustness than other groups.

You should use the right tool for the job :)
